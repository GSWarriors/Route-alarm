# Route-alarm
Wakes up users with an alarm to get them to work on time based on the traffic conditions/weather of that day. 

This project was created to address the concerns of everyday people going to work to ensure they get there on time- to ensure the 
day gets started in the right way. I wrote this project in a team, and we choose this as the app we wanted to create because being on 
time is very important in a busy society where deadlines come and go quickly, so it's very important to be present whenever a project is 
being worked on.
